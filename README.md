# React Weather App
This is a simple weather app built with React that allows users to search for and view the current weather conditions in a given city.

The app makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display the weather data. It displays the current temperature, humidity, and a brief summary of the weather conditions for the selected city.

The user can search for a city by typing the name of the city into the search bar and pressing the "Search" button. The app will then display the current weather conditions for that city.

This app is designed to be a basic example of using React to build a weather app and make API calls to retrieve data. It can be easily customized and expanded upon to add additional features and functionality.
